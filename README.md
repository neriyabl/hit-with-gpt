# hit

> A next-generation, AI-powered version control system – designed to replace Git.

---

## 🧠 What is `hit`?

`hit` is an experimental version control system, written in Rust, that reimagines the way teams collaborate on code. Unlike Git, which relies heavily on manual commits and merges, `hit` introduces intelligent automation powered by AI to streamline your workflow.

## ✨ Key Features (WIP)

- 🔁 **Parallel Development** – Multiple contributors can work simultaneously without constant merge conflicts.
- 🤖 **AI-Aware Commits** – Changes are saved automatically when the system identifies that code is "ready".
- 🧩 **Conflict Minimization** – Uses AI to minimize human intervention in merges.
- 📡 **Real-time Syncing** – Near-instant syncing of changes across clients.
- 🔐 **Secure by Design** – Built-in cryptographic integrity and version traceability.
- 📁 **Centralized or Distributed** – Supports flexible architectures for your organization.
- 🌐 **WebTransport-ready** – Designed to support modern transport layers from day one.

## 🚧 Project Status

`hit` is under early-stage development. Major features are being actively designed and discussed. Expect rapid changes and breaking APIs.
